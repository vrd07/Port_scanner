**Port Scanner designed for offensive security purposes with capabilities for:**

-- Reconnaissance and target enumeration
-- Banner grabbing to identify vulnerable services
-- Providing specific attack recommendations (checking for weak credentials, exploiting vulnerabilities)
-- Being explicitly labeled as a "pentesting" tool for unauthorized system analysis

**The script includes recommendations like "Try anonymous login," "Check for weak credentials," and "vulnerability scanning" which are attack-oriented activities.**
